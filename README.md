# theCalc App

A fun calculator app I built using straight vanilla. It has basic arithmetic functionality but it's still very useful.

HTML, CSS, JS

<h3>Summary</h3>
I built this app because I wanted to always build the classic calculator. I also like math so I enjoyed building it from the beginning through the end. I learned many things from creating this App but one that stands out to me the most is the ability to use JS Math object. I never learned used it before but now I understand it a lot better.
